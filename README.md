# ConcertOrganizer
In This task I made a "blueprint" for a concert organizer application using JAVA programming language. The application is designed in take care of the OOP principles.

Here is the task's description
A Concert Organizer company organizes three kinds of concerts: indoor, outdoor and festival concerts.
Store every concert’s main band, warm up bands, capacity, style (depends on the main band).
Different venues
Let’s talk about alcohol a bit
Every guest is a huge beer fan. Keep track of how many beers are sold in a concert.
Beer prices are the following: indoor - 600 Ft, outdoor - 800 Ft, festival - 1000 Ft.

Calculate the company’s profit from the concerts. They can keep 40% of the ticket sales and the full income from the bar.

Different concert types have different capacity and duration, indoor concerts can hold 3000 people, and take 1,5 hours, outdoor concerts hold 5000 people, and take 2 hours and festivals take 6 hours, with 8000 people at the same time.
Make it possible to cancel outdoor concerts in case it’s raining.
Ticket prices are somewhere between 12000-15000 Ft (one concert has only one kind of ticket). Don’t randomize the price, make it possible for the user to set the price anywhere between the two numbers
Take it 	into account that the concerts don’t always have a full house. Keep track of how many tickets are sold for a concert, and don’t go over the maximum
The company has bands to work with:
Every band has a name and a style (Rock, Pop or Jazz).
Main bands have to decide who is going to cheer up the crowd before they get to the stage. The first Warm up band who has the same style wins this honor.
